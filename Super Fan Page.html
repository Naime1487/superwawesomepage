      <td>Released: March 23, 2004</td>
      <td>Fly or Die, N.E.R.D's second album  has some interesting things about it, for one, the band learned the instruments on the album to play live at shows. Its listed as &quot;rap rock&quot; which is how I would personally describe it, it went on to qualify for RIAA's gold certifications. A common theme with N.E.R.D but especially with this album is the love or hate behind it. Pitchfork calls it &quot;stupid and boring&quot; rating it a measly 3.1 out of ten.</td>

      <td>Seeing Sounds, was a big improvement from 2004's &quot;Fly Or Die&quot;. The band believed their previous album was too consistent. After leaving Virgin Records they decided to lean towards a more Pop sounding album. With unique fast-paced beats with so much going on. The album was solely produced by The Neptunes (Pharrell and Chad) with help from Spymob.</td>

      <td>Nothing is the fourth album from N.E.R.D, continuing this new phase of pop and furthuring away from rap, Pharrel saying &quot;So we though why not make a timeless album thats kind of a time capsule&quot;. Saying he wanted to make good music that would affect people in a good way. Nothing contains blues,soft rock and more pop, specifically psychedelic pop. The album debuted at 21 on the bilboard 200 chart.</td>

      <td>After seven long years N.E.R.D returns, NO_ONE EVER REALLY DIES contains many features like Kendrick Lamar, Rihanna, Andre 3000 and even Ed Sheeran. The album discussed many of Williams political, and econimal feelings of the world, discussing his dislike of former president Donald Trump. &quot;Don't Don't Do It&quot; a song inspired by Keith Scott, who was shot and killed by police in Charlotte North Carolina. They discuss racism and border control. Bringing elements from all previous albums, N.E.R.D comes back well.</td>

	<h1>N.E.R.D's Impact</h1>
<p> N.E.R.D's experimental attempts at mixing different genres would in the end play a big role in music. Specifically in Hip-Hop I think their choice to not specialize in just rap, inspired many artist to do the same. With an example being Pharrell, when people bought tickets to go see N.E.R.D, they expected rap, and hip-hop, espicially because of Williams previous music choices, working with snoop dog and others, and even having his first debut album be hip-hop. With the newer age of music we see artist take inpiration from N.E.R.D and their unique sounds, the frenitic drums and horns. We see artist succesful like The Internet, Steve Lacy, Tyler The Creator and A$AP Ferg sample and pay homage to them, even working with them on their own bodies of music. The internet covered "Tape You" from 2001's "In Search Of..." A$AP Ferg has spoken about how he was inspired my them,saying they made "harmless bangers for getting drunk at the club. Comparing the nuance of them to "trying ice cream when you only knew plain yogurt". &nbsp; </p>
